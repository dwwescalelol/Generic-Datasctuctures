# Generic Datastructures
Generic Datastructures is as u might have guessed, a library of generic data structures. The library was made using C# 
in Visual Studio. The library was tested used is NUnit.

# Why?
In year 2 of MMU Computer Science I did a module called *"Algorithms and Data Structures"* and found the data structures part fascinating. However, when using C# default data structures, I found it hard to really understand what was going on. So, I made this library to further that understanding.
It helped me understand the use of **Interfaces** as well as some basic **Design patterns**.
